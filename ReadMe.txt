This project is about building a convolutional neural network model to detect from a image whether the skin cancer is malignant or benign using tensorflow.

Steps involved using in this project
1. Image processing and normalization for both train and test set using tensorflow
2. Building a CNN model
3. Compiling the model
4. Training the model on the train set and testing it on the test set
5. Plotting the accuracy and loss of both train and test set
